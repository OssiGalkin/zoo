This is an area for miscellaneous user contributions related to [ELFI](https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi). These could be simulators, notebooks, examples, tutorials etc. that for some reason don't fit into the main ELFI repository.

The contents of this repository are not maintained by the elfi-dev admins. However, limited user-support may be asked from elfi-support.at.hiit.fi, but the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/HIIT/elfi?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) is preferable.

To have your contribution added here, simply fork the repo and open a Pull request.
